## Tone control - Aadit Bagdi

- Created a tone control using `scipy.signal.butter` to get the filter coefficients and `scipy.signal.filtfilt` to apply the filter coefficients to the .wav file.
- You can either play a sound in the terminal or write out to an output .wav file using the arguments provided in the homework description.
- Full disclosure here, I got some help from Claude 3.5 since I was overwhelmed by the amount of filter options available in `scipy.signal`.
